ðŸ“± iOS Calculator Clone
A minimalist, pixel-perfect clone of the native iOS calculator, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project replicates the iconic design, fluid animations, and core functionality of Appleâ€™s calculator app, offering a seamless user experience across devices.

âœ¨ Features
ðŸŽ¨ Authentic iOS Design
Every detailâ€”from the dark-themed background to the vibrant orange operator buttonsâ€”mirrors the iOS calculator. The layout uses absolute precision with Tailwind CSS for spacing, shadows, and rounded corners, ensuring visual fidelity.

ðŸ§® Core Functionality
Supports basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (Ã—), division (Ã·), percentage (%), sign toggling (+/-), and all-clear (AC). The logic handles chained calculations (e.g., 5 + 3 Ã— 2) with intuitive precedence.

ðŸ“± Responsive & Touch-Optimized
Designed for mobile-first interactions, with larger buttons for finger-friendly tapping. The UI scales gracefully to desktop, retaining the iOS aesthetic.

âš¡ Smooth Animations
Buttons highlight on-press with subtle opacity changes, mimicking iOSâ€™s tactile feedback. The display text dynamically adjusts size to prevent overflow for large numbers.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
ðŸš€ Next.js powers the project with server-side rendering and efficient routing. TypeScript enforces type safety, reducing runtime errors, while Tailwind CSS streamlines styling with utility-first classes. State management is handled via React hooks (useReducer for complex logic), and ESLint + Prettier maintain code quality.

ðŸŽ¨ Design & Theme
The color scheme exactly matches the iOS calculator:

Background: Pure black (#000000) for contrast.

Display Text: Crisp white (#FFFFFF) with dynamic font scaling.

Number Buttons: Dark gray (#333333) for tactile input.

Operators: Vibrant orange (#FF9500) for actions.

Utility Buttons: Light gray (#A5A5A5) for clear/modifier functions.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Install dependencies using your preferred package manager.

Run the development server to launch the calculator locally.
